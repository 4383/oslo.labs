Openstack Oslo labs

oslo.labs aim to help you to debug Openstack Oslo libraries, by setting up
automatically a complete environment ready for hacking and debug.

Labs provide some preconfigured scenario to help you to test and debug
oslo's libraries and also oslo's projects requirements like `python-memcached`,
`dogpile.cache`, etc...

Each change made on an oslo library or on requirements in your lab are
synchronized with your github forks of each projects, this allow you
to quickly iterate on your changes in your lab, and when you think you
are ready you can rebase all your changes properly to a dedicated branch
ready for review.

## Install

$ git clone git@github.com:4383/oslo.labs.git
$ cd oslo.labs
```

```

Start your lab:

```sh
$ ./run.sh oslo.cache/memcache_pool_backend
```

Enter in your lab:
```sh
$ docker exec -it oslo-lab /bin/zsh
lab $ python lab/app.py
lab $ ls ~/debug # here are all the libs you may want to modify for your tests
```

## Labs

## Overview

A lab is an environment automatically setup with many services.
Oslo libraries aim to to give an abstraction between services and users.
A services could be a memcached server or rabbitmq server by example, and
oslo's users are commonly openstack services like nova, neutron, etc...

A lab provide some scripts to give you an abstraction and emulate openstack
services.
